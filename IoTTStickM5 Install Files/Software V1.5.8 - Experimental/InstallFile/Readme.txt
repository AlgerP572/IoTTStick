This file contains The IoTT Stick software V. 1.5.8 Experimental

Experimental means this is a not officially released version containing the VoiceWatcher feature for testing purposes.
VoiceWatcher reacts on the two keywords STOP and GO received via the Stick's internal microphone and switches the layout power off and on.
Detection success is currently around 80%, so it is not perfect.
Watch https://youtu.be/dP01Lq9poZw for more information about the VoiceWatcher feature.

To install, connect your M5 Stick C to the computer's USB port.
Extract the zip file and execute (double-click) the file update.bat
If everything goes right, the update program will find the stick on the USB port and will load the program and the web pages.

Warning: Uploading a new version will overwrite your current stick configuration. To avoid, you should first save the current configuration to your computer. 
After uploading the new software version, you can write back the previous configuration to the IoTT Stick.
